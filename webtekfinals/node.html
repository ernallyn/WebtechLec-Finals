<h2>Node.JS</h2>
<p>Node.js, often referred to as just Node, is a powerful tool that can run JavaScript applications on both the server side as well as the client side. Node.js can be used to write static file servers, Web application frameworks, messaging middleware, and servers for HTML5 multiplayer games. This article is just an introduction to Node.js.<br>
Node.js is a server side JavaScript built on Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It is an open source programming language that was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009. It allows us to build scalable network applications, and is very fast when compared with other server side programming languages because it is written in C and the non-blocking I/O model. <br>It is a software company specialising in high performance container native infrastructure. Node.js can run on Linux, Sun OS, Mac OS X and Windows platforms.
